Explain the naming conventions for intrinsic functions.
(_<vector_size>_<operation>_<suffix>)


What do the metrics latency and throughput tell you
about the performance of an intrinsic function?


How do modern processors realize instruction-level
parallelism?


How may loop unrolling affect the execution time of
compiled code?



What does a high IPC value (instructions per cycle)
mean in terms of the performance of an algorithm?
